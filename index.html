		<!-- ABOUT the POA -->

			<!-- Article: About -->

				<h2>What are the <span class="patterns">"Patterns"</span>?</h2>

				<p>
					Although I'm from Bjelovar, Croatia, it would only be partially
					correct to say that this is a Croatian project. Patterns of Attachment
					came to be in the spring of 2019 when I quit my job and moved in with
					my girlfriend, who was living in Almaty.
				</p>

				<p>
					It's difficult to say how much my sound would differ if it originated
					from somewhere else. Creativity doesn't depend solely on our
					surroundings. What we carry within ourselves is always intertwined
					with external influences and a lifelong adventure of exploring various
					music genres.
				</p>

				<p>
					Initially, "Patterns" had no specific sound. It was an exploration.
					Since I had barely played the piano before and had always leaned
					towards the guitar, I was learning and enjoying myself. I spent half
					of my day doing web development, and the other half was dedicated to
					developing "Patterns." Compositions, arrangements, and sound colors
					were gradually shaped to become as eloquent as you will hear them
					today.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, before returning to Croatia, the songs that are laid out before
					you got their backbone in the old building on Aimanova street.
					Regardless of what the future may bring in terms of sound and musical
					concepts, the origins of the "Patterns" lie in that area of
					Kazakhstan, 5km below the Alatau mountain and 600km from the Chinese
					border.
				</p>

				<h2>Central themes</h2>

				<p>
					"Patterns" are about patterns of living. Patterns of the world around
					us. Patterns of behaviour. Patterns of attachment to everything and
					everyone that we encounter. They constitute the very fabric of our
					existence and are what make us tick.
				</p>
			</article>

			<!-- Article: Influences -->
			<article class="article js-read-more" data-rm-words="31">
				<h2>Influences</h2>

				<p>
					I love music regardless of genres. Throughout my life, I have listened
					to everything from Black Sabbath, the Doors, and Yellow Magic
					Orchestra, to Bad Religion, Kraftwerk, Iron Maiden, Miles Davis, New
					Order, Aphex Twin, Pet Shop Boys, Leonard Cohen, Dire Straits,
					Ramones, Johnny Cash, Boards of Canada, and many others from these
					respective genres.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although I still love them all, if I were to single out my all-time
					favourite, it would have to be New Order. Their unique blend of
					post-punk and electronic music, coupled with their thought-provoking
					lyrics, has always resonated with me and continues to do so. I find
					myself returning to their music time and time again, discovering new
					nuances and patterns that I had not noticed before. In many ways,
					their music is a microcosm of the larger patterns that I see in the
					world around me, and it is a constant source of inspiration and
					reflection for me.
				</p>

			<!-- Article: Musical direction -->
			<article class="article js-read-more" data-rm-words="32">
				<h2>Musical direction</h2>

				<p>
					After reading about the diverse range of music that I listen to or
					have listened to at some point in my life, an interesting question
					arises: What can you expect from "Patterns"?
				</p>

				<p>
					Intertwined melodies, textured landscapes, deep pronounced bass lines
					and haunting dreamy leads conversing, asking and answering questions
					are what awaits you. All driven by thick, powerful kick beats and the
					marching of hi-hats.
				</p>

				<p>
					It's impossible to categorise it into a single existing genre since
					it's an amalgam of my music tastes and ideas. I always describe it as
					the type of music I would like to hear someone play for me. My wife
					once called it "Galactic Romanticism" and I liked it so much that I
					adopted it as the name of the style. Listen for yourself and you'll
					see that there's no other name that fits.
				</p>

				<p>
					Evoking memories and daydreaming about the future, "Patterns" will
					take you down the road of remembrance and longings for times past and
					those that would be gladly welcomed again. "Patterns" will show you
					what attachment means - what you do with it is up to you.

				<h2>Visual art</h2>

				<p>
					Trees and leaves, river deltas, galaxies, blood vessels, seashells,
					DNA, flowers, snowflakes, mountains, water drops and coastlines, to
					name just a few, are examples of fractals in nature.
				</p>

				<p>
					A fractal is a never ending pattern that repeats itself at different
					scales. It is defined as a fragmented geometric shape which can be
					split into parts that are considered a reduced copy of the whole
					(think of a tree as a whole and a small branch of the same tree as a
					reduced copy).
				</p>

				<div class="tree">
					<video controls width="250">
						<source src="./img/fractal-tree.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
					</video>
				</div>

				<p>
					Some of the practical uses of fractals are in computer file
					compression systems, architecture of the networks that make up the
					internet, production of stunning and realistic computer graphics,
					landscapes in sf movies, prediction of earthquakes and even in
					description of variations in a person's heartbeat.
				</p>

				<p>
					In "Patterns of Attachment," fractals represent human relationships.
					They are complex and have multiple layers, just like fractals. They
					can be simple or intricate, and the dynamics between individuals can
					be affected by various factors. Human behavior can also be seen as
					fractal-like. Our actions and decisions can have a ripple effect on
					those around us, just like how a small change in a fractal pattern can
					result in a significant shift in the overall shape.
				</p>

				<p>
					Similar to fractals, relationships can be both beautiful and
					fascinating, while also being unpredictable and chaotic. Through its
					use of fractals in art, POA aims to gain a deeper appreciation for the
					complexity and interconnectedness of our relationships and the world
					around us.
				</p>

				<p>
					Fractals shape us and our interactions with people and the world
					around us on a daily basis even if we don't notice it and have never
					thought about it.
